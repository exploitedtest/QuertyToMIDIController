‚è∫ Next Steps for MIDI Controller Implementation

  Phase 2: Enhanced MIDI Controls (Next Priority)

  Velocity Curves System

  - Implement velocity curve interface in types.ts
  - Create velocity processor module with presets (linear, exponential, logarithmic)
  - Add custom curve editor UI component
  - Integrate velocity processing into MIDI engine

  Advanced MIDI Features

  - Aftertouch simulation based on key hold duration
  - Configurable note-off velocity
  - MIDI CC controls via modifier keys (Shift+key for mod wheel, etc.)
  - MIDI panic button implementation in UI

  Phase 3: Settings & Persistence

  - LocalStorage-based settings manager
  - Export/import configuration as JSON
  - Preset management system with save/load/delete
  - Keyboard shortcut customization interface

  Phase 4: Basic Arpeggiator

  - Core arpeggiator engine with timing logic
  - Pattern implementations (up, down, up/down, random)
  - BPM control and gate length adjustment
  - UI controls and visual pattern indicator

  Phase 5: Performance Features

  - Note priority modes (last, highest, lowest)
  - Glide/portamento between notes
  - Scale mode highlighting on piano keys
  - Multiple pedal support (sostenuto, soft)
  - DAW transport controls via F-keys

  Phase 6: Advanced Arpeggiator & WebAssembly

  - WebAssembly module for precise timing
  - Swing/shuffle controls
  - Chord mode implementation
  - MIDI clock sync capability

  Phase 7: PWA & Offline Support

  - Service Worker implementation
  - App manifest for installability
  - Offline functionality
  - Update notifications

  Technical Debt & Improvements

  - Add comprehensive error handling
  - Implement unit tests for core modules
  - Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
  - Performance optimization for large note counts
  - Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

  ---
  The TypeScript foundation is solid and ready for feature implementation. Each phase builds upon the previous one, gradually transforming this into a professional-grade MIDI controller.
